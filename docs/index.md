# Welcome to the Environmental Change and Human Outcomes (ECHO) Lab!

## What is the ECHOLab? 

The [EchoLab][echo_lab], now part of the [Doerr School of Sustainability]
[sust_web], is a multidisciplinary team spanning from social and earth
scientists, and epidemiologists with the common goal of measuring and
understanding the effects of environmental change on present and future human
systems. 

## What is in here? 

This is a compilation of different advice from _past_ and _current_ members of
the team. We aspire to have a live-document that unifies the knowledge
available in disparate places across the web, such as computation resources,
graduate student resources or RAs benefits and opportunities. We also intent to
have an _on-boarding_ document that soft-lands the new members of our team. 

This document is crowd-sourced and it needs your help to keep it up-to-date and
in good shape for others to use. Once you become a tenured ECHOer, you need to
share your new tricks here to others. See the [contributing guidelines](conibute).
